# AI-Chat-Application-using-ChatGPT-API
This project is a simple web application that allows users to interact with the ChatGPT API. The user can input a question or prompt, and the application will send this input to the ChatGPT API, which will then generate a response. The response is displayed back to the user on the webpage.
